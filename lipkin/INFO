In this folder one may find code relating to the lipkin model. In the subfolder is the old project from Nuclear Structure for comparison.

Currently there is much code related to building state sets, for memory allocation, counting, etc, but the file itself, lipkin.cpp, has problems. Whether I simply need to isolate specific states or the project model was too simplistic, I am unsure, since the number of states do not much up. A thought is to combine all states with like Jm values, add a weighting factor, and go from there.
